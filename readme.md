# Final Fantasy Brave Exvius Helper
An application to help picking units and organising parties.

http://finalfantasyexvius.com

## What is it?
This is an application, mostly a front-end for a database of Final Fantasy Brave Exvius units.

The idea behind it is to get better insight into which units to use, their stats, and to help with selecting units for 
the optimum party based on various statistics.

## Requirements
* CakePHP 3.3+
* MySQL 5.7+
* PHP 5.5.9+

## Installation
The repo can be cloned into a folder, and then the dependancies installed with `composer install`.
Then you'll probably want to create a virtual host to run the application. 
[Find out more on the CakePHP book](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/installation.html#fire-it-up).

## Thanks
Thanks to the good folks over at [ExviusWiki.com](http://exviuswiki.com/) as I used their pages to build my database.
